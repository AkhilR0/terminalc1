##This can be done by looping through the x and y coordinates in game_state.game_map with range(game_state.ARENA_SIZE). 
# Check to see if the location is in the arena bounds and if the game map contains a stationary unit at that location 
# (both member function of the game map, with I recommend getting familiar with). If so, add it to your list.

for x in range(game_state.ARENA_SIZE):

    print(x)
